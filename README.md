This project is an **AI-powered assistant** designed to help researchers, doctors, and students access and analyze **medical research papers and knowledge sources** more effectively. It leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to provide accurate, context-aware, and explainable answers.

## 📚 What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a framework that combines **retrieval systems** with **generative AI**:

1. A **retriever** fetches the most relevant documents from a knowledge base (vector database).
2. A **generator (LLM)** uses these documents as context to produce accurate and grounded answers.

This prevents hallucinations and ensures that answers are **fact-based and explainable**, which is especially critical in **medical research**.

## 🤖 What is an LLM?

A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is an AI system trained on vast amounts of text data.
It can understand, reason, and generate human-like responses.
Examples include **GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3, and Mistral**.

When combined with **RAG**, LLMs:

* Provide **accurate Q\&A** from medical knowledge bases
* Summarize long research papers
* Explain complex terms in **simple language**
* Assist in **hypothesis generation and literature review**
